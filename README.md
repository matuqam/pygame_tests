# About the "game"
This is a platformer style game.
A player character is controlled mostly side ways, can jump and fall. The "camera"
follows the players character (with a little lag for smoothness).
Parallax effect is used to display items that are further or closser in an
appropriate way.

# Development
The game consists of a main file `Platformer.py` and an `engine.py` file (aka engine).
The engine provides generic reussable classes and functions.
